<div>
  Specify the repository to track. This can be a URL or a local file path.
  <br>
  If the repository is a super-project (a repository with submodules), the
  location from which to clone submodules is dependent on whether the repository
  is bare or non-bare (i.e. has a working directory).
  <ul>
    <li>If the super-project is bare, the location of the submodules will be
    taken from <i>.gitmodules</i>.</li>
    <li>If the super-project is <b>not</b> bare, it is assumed that the
    repository has each of its submodules cloned and checked out appropriately.
    Thus, the submodules will be taken directly from a path like
    <code>${SUPER_PROJECT_URL}/${SUBMODULE}</code>, rather than relying on
    information from <i>.gitmodules</i>.</li>
  </ul>

  For a local URL/path to a super-project,
  <i>git rev-parse --is-bare-repository</i>
  is used to detect whether the super-project is bare or not.
  <br>
  For a remote URL to a super-project, the ending of the URL determines whether
  a bare or non-bare repository is assumed:
  <ul>
    <li>If the remote URL ends with <i>/.git</i>, a <i>non</i>-bare repository is
    assumed.</li>
    <li>If the remote URL does <b>NOT</b> end with <i>/.git</i>, a bare
    repository is assumed.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
